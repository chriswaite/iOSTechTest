Just Eat Test Automation Engineer Recruitment Test - iOS
==================================

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

* [A technical test](#technical-test)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

In order to avoid bounced emails we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant zip file to a shared Google Drive folder. In order to obtain the URL for this folder, please supply your Gmail or Google-based email address to either your agent or the Just Eat member of staff who assigned you the test.

Please make this a **single** zip file named `{yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip` containing:

1. a single markdown file with the answers to the technical questions
2. one folder containing the technical test

## Technical Test

The sample app in this project is a very basic todo list, with functionality to add, complete and delete tasks. Completed tasks are moved from the Active view to the Archive view. The complete and delete buttons are uncovered by swiping the tasks cells to the left.

Write 3 or more UI tests to cover the functionality in the app. Structure your tests and framework in whichever way you deem best.

### Notes

* There is no persistance, so you don't need to worry about clearing data between test runs
* Passing the string "CONFIGURE_TEST_DATA" as a launch argument will configure some tasks for you to use in your tests if you want them.

### Platform Choice

You can write the tests using any language and framework you are experienced with.

### Task requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met. 

- Please complete the task described above.
- You should provide clear instructions on your test setup and how to execute your tests. The clarity and precision of these instructions - and the ease with which the interviewers can execute them - will be a key part of the assessment. Please create a README file detailing said instructions. Please also use this file for listing any additional comments or observations you might want to share about your submission.

# Technical questions

Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
4. How would you improve the customer experience of the Just Eat website?
5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
